K mediod clusttering for mall customer dataset

• Developed an unsupervised learning clustering project, which can make clusters based on specific features in the dataset.

• Mall_customer dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains customer’s information like gender, age, Annual income, and spending. Using features (age, annual income, spending), the cost was calculated using Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance.

• Initially, K (4) points were selected as medoids and each data point in the dataset was iterated, then associated with the closest medoid. Cost of each datapoint was calculated and assigned to the nearest cluster. Each cluster contains many data points or instances. In our project, 4 clusters were created as the value of K was 4. Clusters were represented in the 3D graph because we used only 3 features. It can be adjusted as per requirement. This knowledge can be applied in any domain get the insights of the business or model.
